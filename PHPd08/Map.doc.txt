####################

The Map class handles the map and the display of objects.

You can construct a Map instance with :
	$VAR = new Map($long, $larg);

Parameters _long and _larg are mandatory.
They represent the size of the map. Both are protected static.
Childs may overwrite the constructor.

The attributes map is an array containing the map, it is public.

This is the methods you can use :
	->	init_map()
	This will prepare and fullfill the map with dot.

	-> init_obs($obs)
	This integrates into the map the obstacles. This method need as a parameter an array gathering the obstacles to display. (See Obstacles documentation for more information on those)

	-> init_ships($ships)
	Same as init_obs but with the ships. This method needs an array containing the ships. (See Ships documentation for more info)

	-> display()
	This methods enables you to display the map. For a proper usage it is better to have call init_map, init_obs and init_ships before in order to display a fullfilled map.

	-> __ToString()
	Method magic __ToString, is called when one tries to echo/print the map. Use it only for debugging.
