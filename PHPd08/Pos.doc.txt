Pos Documentation
####################

The Pos class handles the different position of every elements we use in this project and can check if one collides with another.

You can construct a Pos instance with :
	$VAR = new Pos(array('x' => '', 'y' => '', 'x_l' => '', 'y_l' => ''));
		X: Refers to the coordonate x;
		Y: Refers to the coordonate y;
		X_l: Refers to the length of the object, horizontal;
		Y_l: Refers to the length of the object, vertical;


The Pos class uses the following traits :
	is_conflictwith :	
		-> function is_conflictwith($args) : Call this to check if there is positioning conflict with the objects sent in parameters (Array of Obstacles, see the matching documentation);
		-> function is_conflictwithborder() : Call this to check if there is conflict with the map borders, it takes no argument.
			FYI, you CANT redefine theses two functions in childs.

This is the methods you can use :

	-> __ToString()
	Method magic __ToString, is called when one tries to echo/print the info of the ship. Use it only for debugging.

	->doc()
	Display the documentation (this current doc) of the Class Pos
