####################

The Obstacle class handles the obstacles and position of objects we don't want our ship to collide with !

You can construct a Obstacle instance with :
	$VAR = new Obstacle(Pos, Pdv);
		Pos, position on the map (See Class Pos documentation)
		Pdv: Health of the obstacle.
	Childs may overwrite the constructor.

The Obstacle class implements the following interface :
	public function getAttacked($args);
	If ones create a child it must have this function!!


The Obstacle class uses the following traits :
	GetAttacked :
		-> function getAttacked($arg) : Call this function with one parameter, the damage dealt. It checks the health and substrate the damage to the health/shield of the ship.
			FYI, you can redefine this function in childs.

This is the methods you can use :
	-> __ToString()
	Method magic __ToString, is called when one tries to echo/print the info of the Obstacle. Use it only for debugging.
	->doc()
	Display the documentation (this current doc) of the Class Obstacle
